## Yet another JSON parser (small, fast, correct and no dependencies)

I wanted a JSON parser, without all kinds of bloat, that simply and efficiently parses JSON correctly (ECMA-404) and produces something useful for reading JSON REST messages...

Couldn't find it, so I decided to write my own. And guess what? It wasn't actually very difficult. As a bonus there are also two handy builders to write JSON messages (anonymous object or array).

(Examples of usage may be found in the Tests.java file.)
