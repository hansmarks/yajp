Yet another JSON parser (small, fast ,correct and no dependencies) © 2023 by J.R. Marks is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

I wanted a JSON parser without all kinds of bloat that simply and efficiently parses JSON correctly (ECMA-404) and produces something useful for processing JSON REST responses.

Couldn't find it, so I decided to write my own. And guess what? It wasn't actually very difficult. As a bonus it also has handy methods to generate JSON messages (anonymous object or array).

There is no license for using it. It is NOT open source, it is copyrighted software. But if you think it could be useful to you, just ask me (yajp@imac.freedom.nl) for consent.

Unless it will be (part of) something you sell or rent (when we will be talking about my fair share ;-) I will probably simply allow it.
