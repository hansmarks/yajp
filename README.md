I wanted a JSON parser without all kinds of bloat that simply and efficiently parses JSON correctly (ECMA-404) and produces something useful for reading JSON REST messages.

Couldn't find it, so I decided to write my own. And guess what? It wasn't actually very difficult. As a bonus it also has handy methods to write JSON messages (anonymous object or array).
